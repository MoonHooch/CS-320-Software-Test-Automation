I ensure that my code and applications are secure by testing it under a wide variety of conditions.
Simulating test scenarios that would occur in an actual use cas, not increases the likelihood of finding
runtime bugs, but it keeps the requirements aligned with the user needs. Using techniques such as 
boundary analysis and input partitioning tests a vast sample of inputs efficiently and targets the most 
likely location of defects. My approach to software design incorporates consistent, secure architecture 
in order to ensure that testing can maintain a high quality as the system develops in complexity.
